  <summary>1. Assessing Information Security Risk</summary>

  - **Information Security Governance:** Guidance for Information Security Managers (PDF) beneficial for CISSP as well.
  - **Identify the Importance of Risk Management**
    - Explain risk management principles.
      - **Risk Responses:** avoid, accept, mitigate, transfer
        - **Accept:** Vulnerability is known (e.g., $500,000 issue, $150,000 fix, they decline the fix and accept the risk as a cost of doing business).
        - **Avoid:** (Add explanation here)
        - **Mitigate:** Lower risk down to an acceptable level. Documentation is key. This does **not** eliminate the risk.
        - **Transfer:** (Add explanation here)
    - We deal with **negative** risk.
  - **Assess Risk**
  - **Mitigate Risk**
  - **Integrate Documentation into Risk Management**
